**What Is This Fork In Here For?**

This fork is in the kstreet GitHub account because the fork is the copy that is referenced and currently used with:

- A private `.MvxPlugins` project needs to review code changes in the `monotouch-samples\StoreKit` sample to keep itself current.

**How Fresh Is This?**

- The code in this fork was current/similar to the `monotouch-samples`
 repo up through [this January 14, 2014 commit](https://github.com/xamarin/monotouch-samples/commit/53ef23cbe4177e9e7daf414c78975f2cc47996d7).
